			<h1>My Favorite Video Games</h1>
				<h2>Here is a little bit about my favorite Hobby.</h2>
					<p>
					For as long as I could remember, Video Games have always been 
					a very important part of my life. From a very young age, I would always
					be on the lookout for the coolest computer games that were out. It started with 
					sites like <a href="http://www.miniclip.com/games/en/">Miniclip.com</a>. I would 
					sit in front of the computer for hours.
